The Empathic Zen - A Generalized Zen of Coding
==============================================
	Speakability counts.
	Readability is better than ugly.
	Pronounceability is better than Readability.
	Speakability is better than Pronounceability.
	Patterns aren't native to your domain but help to describe it. 
	It won't be speakable, unless its native to your domain.
	If the implementation is hard to read out loud, it's hard to explain.
	If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
	If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
	Explicit is better than implicit.
	Simple is better than complex.
	Complex is better than complicated.
	Flat is better than nested.
	Sparse is better than dense.
	Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
	Although practicality beats purity.
	Be optimistic and don't be too defensive.
	Your program is not a collection of errorcases.
	In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. Test instead.
	It's better to have 200 things that fail for one reason than to have 1 thing that fails for 200 reasons.
	There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
	Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
	Now is better than never.
	Although never is often better than *right* now.
	Small Modules,Namespaces,Classes and Functions are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
